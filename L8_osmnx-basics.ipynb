    "### What is OSMnx?\n",
    "\n",
    "OSMnx is a Python package that lets you **download geospatial data from OpenStreetMap** and model, project, **visualize, and analyze real-world street networks** and any other geospatial geometries. You can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with other infrastructure types, amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, and speed/travel time.\n",

    "### What is OpenStreetMap (OSM)?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a digital map database of the world built through crowdsourced volunteered geographic information (VGI). OSM is supported by the nonprofit OpenStreetMap Foundation. **The data from OSM is freely available for visualization, query and download**.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSM works in a style similar to Wikipedia, in which virtually all features are open to editing. Since its establishment in 2004, this map database has matured enough in some locations to the point where its detail and precision rival \"authoritative\" datasets from governments and commercial entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data available via OSM\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as other spatial data, the 2 essential ingredients of OSM data are **geometry** and **descriptive attributes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To contribute a feature to OSM, you typically digitize a geometry (a point, line, or area) and then add descriptive attributes, or tags. For example, to tag a grocery store, you trace its building footprint and tag it with `shop=supermarket`. There's no restriction on the tags you can use, but the data is only useful to the degree that you tag things consistent with the way other OSM users have applied the tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "To promote consistency in tagging, the OSM community has an informal tag voting and approval process organized on the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) site. Approved tags are added to the online documentation so that others can easily find and apply them. For example, the tag `shop=supermarket` denotes a grocery store (see the [Wiki page of shop=supermarket](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:shop=supermarket)). Before you add a tag, check the wiki to make sure that you're using the established tag and syntax.\n",

    "### Extract street network from a point with provided distance distance\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick way to extract street network is to first provide a point on earth (in latitude/longitude), then provide a euclidean distance. This generates a rectangular boundary (*bounding box* (*bbox*) in jargon), and OSMnx will use this boundary to \"clip\" the street network from OSM.\n",

    "The `graph_from_point` takes the following arguments:\n",
